# stego_programs.py
Short scripts for encoding and decoding stegonography msgs into .png files
These programs will only work for .png files b/c they are lossless compression
They will not work for .jpg or .jpeg files because they are lossy compression
The message to be encoded should be saved as a seperate .txt file
