# stego_programs.py
Two short scripts for encoding and decoding .png files with stegonography
These programs will only work for .png files b/c they are lossless compression
They will not work for .jpg or .jpeg files because they are lossy compression
The message to be encoded should be saved as a seperate .txt file
